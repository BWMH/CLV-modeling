# CLV-modeling
CLV is an important metric used in marketing and customer analytics to estimate value a customer is expected to generate in a next few months.
In this project, I build a CLV model (BG/NBD & Gamma Gamma) using history transaction data. The model can be used to segment customer and apply specialize marketing campagin to each type of customer.
